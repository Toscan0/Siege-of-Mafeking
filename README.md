# Siege-of-Mafeking

This game portrays the siege of Mafeking, where Baden Powell successfully used the children of the village of Mafeking to pass secret messages. It was here that he realised the value of these kids and their determination and willingness to help. 

It was at this moment that B.P. had the idea of creating the Scouting movement.

Feel free to use this game in your scout group ⚜️
